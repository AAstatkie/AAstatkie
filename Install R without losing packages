# To retain all of your previously installed installed packages when installing a new version of R.
# Based on the tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKBeV4BNeuk&ab_channel=MohammadNasirAbdullah

# 1. Before you upgrade, build a temp file with all of your old packages.
all<-installed.packages()
all
old<-as.vector(all[is.na(all[,"Priority"]), 1])
save(old, file="old.installed.rda")
getwd()

# 2. Install the new version of R and let it do its thing.

# 3. Once you've got the new version up and running, reload the saved packages 
	# and re-install them from CRAN.
current<-installed.packages()
new<-as.vector(current[is.na(current[,"Priority"]), 1]) # Not to install already installed packages (in base R)
load(old) # Or, if you have R or R Studio restarted, go to File -> Open File and locate the the file "old.installed.rda" and load it.
check<-setdiff(old, new)
install.packages(check)
